# Why (We) Make Room For `console.log` 

## Why are any of us here?
### To fix what ain't broke!

I have been programming for about 10 years. I spent the first four pretending to learn Java in college and then started with JavaScript in 2014. That was a little before Babel and the proposals for ES6 were introduced. I have gotten to see what JavaScript had been, the promise of what it would become, and now to see it surpass all expectation. Modern JavaScript, the evolution of the language starting with ES6, has been incredible but it has left a pinprick of a problem. 

### The Ktchn Snk 

Bellow is an example function that is using a slew modern JS features:

{% runkit
 
const isEqual = require('lodash.isequal');
const moment = require('moment');

function formatCurrency(num) {
    return (
        '$' +
        num.toString().replace(/(\d\d\d(?=[^.]))/g, function($1) {
            return $1 + ',';
        })
    );
}
const transactionData = {
    amount: 100,
    date: Date.now(),
    description: 'Shrimp! Heaven! Now!',
    type: '',
    from: 'Daniel',
    to: 'Mom'
};
%}
const pickAndFormatTransaction = ( {
        amount,
        date,
        description
} ) => ( {
        amount: Number( amount )
            ? formatCurrency( amount ) 
            : amount,
        date: moment( date ).format( 'DD/MM/YYY' ),
        description
} );

console.log(pickAndFormatTransaction(transactionData));
{% endrunkit %}
<span></span><figcaption>‚ùìWhat do you think this function would have looked like <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/compassionate-fire-o6xnd?fontsize=14&view=preview">just a few years ago?</a></figcaption>

The function is concise and deliberate. By which I mean there is no extra syntax. I don't need to use a `return`, which also means I don't need to declare a `const resultingObject =...;` to return. I dodged having to name the parameter just to pull out some values. I also don't need to create an `if/else` block for `amount`. I don't mean to diminish things like `return` or explicitly naming values. They have their place, instead, I relish in how sparse the function can be, while still being understandable. In my eagerness to cut down on clutter, I have created a new hurdle.
 
The `pickAndFormatTransaction` is so concise, there's no room for a `console.log`. If something goes wrong it‚Äôs going to take extra work to debug it.

### Something Goes Wrong

{% runkit
 
const isEqual = require('lodash.isequal');
const moment = require('moment');
const diff = require('jest-diff');

function formatCurrency(num) {
    return (
        '$' +
        num.toString().replace(/(\d\d\d(?=[^.]))/g, function($1) {
            return $1 + ',';
        })
    );
}

function pickAndFormatTransaction({ amount, date, description }) {
    return {
        amount: Number(amount) ? formatCurrency(amount) : amount,
        date: moment(date).format('DD/MM/YYY'),
        description
    };
}
%}
const expected = {
    amount: '$0.00',
    date: '19/05/2019',
    description: 'Shrimp! Heaven! Now!'
};

const actual = pickAndFormatTransaction({
    amount: 0,
    date: 1558307309712,
    description: 'Shrimp! Heaven! Now!'
});

// MDN.io/console/assert
console.assert(
	isEqual(expected, actual),
	'EXPAND FOR PRETTY DIFF: \n%s', // Using string substitutions MDN.io/console#Usage
	diff(expected, actual)
); 

{% endrunkit %}
<span></span><figcaption>Run and Take Cover, This Will Fail!</figcaption>

Even if you know why `amount` is wrong, how would you go about adding `console.log` to the troubled code?

{% runkit
 
const isEqual = require('lodash.isequal');
const moment = require('moment');
const diff = require('jest-diff');

function formatCurrency(num) {
    return (
        '$' +
        num.toString().replace(/(\d\d\d(?=[^.]))/g, function($1) {
            return $1 + ',';
        })
    );
}
%}
const pickAndFormatTransaction = ( {
        amount,
        date,
        description
} ) => ( {
        amount: Number( amount )
            ? formatCurrency( amount ) 
            : amount,
        date: moment( date ).format( 'DD/MM/YYY' ),
        description
} );

const expected = {
    amount: '$0.00',
    date: '19/05/2019',
    description: 'Shrimp! Heaven! Now!'
};

const actual = pickAndFormatTransaction({
    amount: 0,
    date: 1558307309712,
    description: 'Shrimp! Heaven! Now!'
});

// MDN.io/console/assert
console.assert(
	isEqual(expected, actual),
	'EXPAND FOR PRETTY DIFF: \n%s', // Using string substitutions MDN.io/console#Usage
	diff(expected, actual)
); 

{% endrunkit %}
<span></span><figcaption>üõ† Break open the code and try adding `console.log` to see why the amount isn't coming out right.</figcaption> 

I took a swing at it as well.
```js
const pickAndFormatTransaction = ( {
        amount,
        date,
        description
} ) => {
	const formattedAmount = Number( amount )
            ? formatCurrency( amount ) 
            : amount
	console.log( Number( amount ), formattedAmount )
	return {
        amount: formattedAmount,
        date: moment( date ).format( 'DD/MM/YYY' ),
        description
} };
```

If yours is anything like mine, it's none too pretty. I suppose "pretty" is subjective but work with me here, it'll be worth it. 

## `console.log -> undefined`
You may have noticed that when you‚Äôve run the RunKit examples above you see the `console.log` output and then `undefined`. That `undefined` is the result of `console.log(...)`. This is why debugging is cumbersome as we have to bend over backward and around `console.log` or rather `undefined`. I have yet to see a time when I need that `undefined`. We could save ourselves plenty of work if `console.log` returned the value it was logging instead of `undefined`.

## `console.tap`

I've created `console.tap` to be the logging function modern JS has been missing.
{% runkit %}
console.tap = v => {
    console.log( v )
    return v
};
{% endrunkit %}
<span></span><figcaption><strong>Oo Aah</strong></figcaption><figcaption><sub>‚Ä¶wait, that's it?</sub></figcaption>

First, yes I'm adding it to the global console object. That is my choice, I'm a mad man. Second, the function revolves around simplicity. It takes one value, logs _that_ value, and returns _that_ value. To the calling function, and the context around it, nothing happens. Which means there is no extra overhead or setup to debugging.

### Using Tap 
We'll return to `pickAndFormatTransaction` later. Instead here's something a little smaller.

{% runkit
 
function parseNumbers(num) {
    return Number(num) || 0;
}
function removeEvens(num) {
    return num % 2;
}
%}
const result = ['1', '2', 'zero' , 3, 4, 5]
    .map(parseNumbers)
    .filter(removeEvens)
    .reduce(( acc, v ) => Math.max(acc, v));
    
console.log(result);
{% endrunkit %}
<span></span><figcaption>‚ùìThere is no bug here ( at least I don't think there is ) but where would you put the `console.log` if there was?</figcaption>

`map`, `reduce`, and `filter` were some of the first indications of where ES6 and modern JS were heading. When you chain them together you get the same issue as before. There's no room to fit a `console.log`. You have to rip the chain apart to see what is going on in the middle of it.

```js
const filtered = ['1', '2', 'zero' , 3, 4, 5]
    .map(parseNumbers)
    .filter(removeEvens);
console.log( filtered );

const res = filtered.reduce(( acc, v ) => Math.max(acc, v));
```

`console.tap` on the other hand can fit just about anywhere.

{% runkit
 
function parseNumbers(num) {
    return Number(num) || 0;
}
function removeEvens(num) {
    return num % 2;
}
%}
const result = console.tap(['1', '2', 'zero' , 3, 4, 5]
    .map(parseNumbers)
    .filter(removeEvens)) // <- this parens closes `tap`
    .reduce(( acc, v ) => Math.max(acc, v));
    
console.log(result);
{% endrunkit %}
<span></span><figcaption>üõ† move around <strong>just</strong> the closing `)` for `console.tap` to see each result</figcaption>

`console.tap`  could have also been used on each part of the chain since each function produces an array.

#### Function Composition

This example doesn't even need any modern features and it still suffers from the same problem.

{% runkit
 
function getUserId( user ) {
	return user.id
}

const storage = {
    store: { user: '{"id":1}' },
    getItem( name ) {
        return this.store[name]
    }
}

%}

var userID = getUserId(
	JSON.parse(storage.getItem( 'user' ))
);
{% endrunkit %}
<span></span><figcaption> ‚ùì Anyone else excited for the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator">pipeline  operator</a>?</figcaption>

If and when `JSON.parse` erupts with `Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1`, you've got to yank out `storage.getItem` to realize you accidentally stored `[object Object]`  but with `tap`:

{% runkit
 
function getUserId( user ) {
	return user.id
}

const storage = {
    store: { user: '{"id":1}' },
    getItem( name ) {
        return this.store[name]
    }
}

%}

const userID = getUserId(
    JSON.parse(
        console.tap( storage.getItem( 'user' ) )
    )
);
{% endrunkit %}
<span></span><figcaption> üõ† Move around `console.tap`. What do you get from `console.tap(JSON).parse`? </figcaption>

As for`pickAndFormatTransaction`, _that_ overachiever,  why don‚Äôt you give `tap` a try. 

#### The Ktchn Snk

{% runkit
 
const isEqual = require('lodash.isequal');
const moment = require('moment');

function formatCurrency(num) {
    return (
        '$' +
        num.toString().replace(/(\d\d\d(?=[^.]))/g, function($1) {
            return $1 + ',';
        })
    );
}
const transactionData = {
    amount: 100,
    date: Date.now(),
    description: 'Shrimp! Heaven! Now!',
    type: '',
    from: 'Daniel',
    to: 'Mom'
};
%}
const pickAndFormatTransaction = ( {
        amount,
        date,
        description
} ) => ( {
        amount: Number( amount )
            ? formatCurrency( amount ) 
            : amount,
        date: moment( date ).format( 'DD/MM/YYY' ),
        description
} );

console.log(pickAndFormatTransaction(transactionData));
{% endrunkit %}
<span></span><figcaption>üõ† throw in a few `console.tap`s and see what you can see.</figcaption>

Without adding anything but  `console.tap`  you can log the whole returning object, or to anything involved in amount and moment. For `description` you will still have to expand the shorthand to  `description: description`. 

## `Have Fun!`

I have created a module for `console.tap` that takes care of some extra details but the function declaration is so small you can write it yourself when you need it.

{% runkit %}
console.tap = v => {
    console.log(v);
    return v;
};

// or, for the bold
console.tap = v => (console.log(v), v);
{% endrunkit %}
